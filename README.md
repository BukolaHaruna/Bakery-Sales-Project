# Porfolio-Excel-Projects
A collection of Excel projects where I explore data analysis, automation, and visualisation. From cleaning messy datasets to building dynamic dashboards, each project showcases how I use Excel to solve real-world problems. 

## Bakery Sales
Project Summary: Bakery Sales Analysis
The Excel file contains three sheets: Bakery, Pivot Table, and Dashboard.
This project analyses bakery sales data to show trends in customer purchases. The dataset includes transaction details with timestamps, item names, and sales periods (day parts and weekdays/weekends). 
## Key insights include:
- Sales Trends by Time of Day – Most purchases occur in the morning and afternoon, with minimal activity at night.
Weekday vs. Weekend Sales – Sales volume varies between weekdays and weekends, influencing business strategies.
Top-Selling Items – Items like coffee and bread are top performers, guiding inventory decisions.
Quarterly Sales Performance – Sales fluctuate across quarters, helping to identify peak demand periods.

This project uses Excel pivot tables and dashboards for visualisation, making insights clear and actionable.
